# Grand Strategy Game - Core Design Document

## Game Vision Statement

**Core Fantasy**: "*I am the ruler of an ancient Mediterranean power, balancing the competing interests of my people while expanding my influence through diplomacy, warfare, and economic might.*"

This is a grand strategy game that captures the **political reality** of ancient rulership - where every decision creates winners and losers among your subjects, and success comes from understanding and managing these internal dynamics rather than just optimizing abstract numbers.

---

## Core Pillars

### 1. **Interest Groups Drive Everything**
Unlike traditional grand strategy games where you fight external enemies while managing abstract concepts like "stability," this game puts **internal politics at the center**. Every action you take affects different groups within your society, creating a web of political consequences that feel organic and meaningful.

### 2. **Meaningful Long-Term Consequences**  
Actions should create **cascading effects** over time rather than immediate, predictable outcomes. Building up your military makes conquests easier, but also shifts power toward your generals. Successful trade enriches merchants, but may alienate traditional landowners. Players must think like actual rulers - balancing immediate needs with long-term stability.

### 3. **Authentic Ancient World Feel**
The game captures the **essence** of ancient Mediterranean politics without overwhelming detail. Different government types (republics, monarchies, tribal confederations) feel genuinely different to play, not just different numbers on the same systems.

## Core Game Loop

### The Political Balancing Act
1. **Assess Situation**: What do my interest groups want? What are my external threats/opportunities?
2. **Make Decisions**: Choose policies, start wars, build infrastructure - each action affects multiple groups
3. **Manage Consequences**: React to how groups respond, deal with unexpected outcomes
4. **Adapt Strategy**: Adjust approach based on shifting political landscape

### The Ruler's Dilemma
Every significant decision should present **interesting trade-offs** rather than obvious choices:
- Expand territory → Military loves it, but Population suffers from conscription and Economic groups worry about war costs
- Negotiate peace → Population and Economic groups are relieved, but Military feels dishonored and may become restless
- Invest in infrastructure → Long-term benefits for everyone, but immediate tax burden on Population

## Key Mechanics & Feelings

### Interest Group System

**What It Is:**
Three core groups that represent different segments of your society:
- **Military**: Generals, soldiers, veterans, warrior classes
- **Economic**: Merchants, tax collectors, urban artisans, trade guilds  
- **Population**: Farmers, provincials, common people, rural masses

**What It Should Feel Like:**
- **Political Maneuvering**: "I need the military's support for this war, but I can't anger the merchants too much or my economy collapses"
- **Realistic Constraints**: "I can't just do whatever I want - I need to keep my key supporters happy"
- **Emergent Storytelling**: "My generals are getting too powerful, but I need them to finish this campaign"

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ **Mathematical Optimization**: Groups shouldn't be just +/- numbers to manage
- ❌ **Arbitrary Penalties**: Low approval shouldn't just give -10% to random stats
- ❌ **Ignored Consequences**: Players shouldn't be able to easily bypass group displeasure

### Economic System

**What It Is:**
Simple but meaningful economic choices - provinces generate income, you spend on armies and buildings, trade affects prosperity.

**What It Should Feel Like:**
- **Resource Tension**: "I want to expand my army, but I'm already struggling to pay for what I have"
- **Investment Decisions**: "This infrastructure will pay off in 20 years, but I need cash now"
- **Trade-off Clarity**: Clear understanding of costs vs benefits for all economic choices

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ **Spreadsheet Simulator**: Too many economic variables to track
- ❌ **Meaningless Abundance**: Economy shouldn't become trivial once you're successful
- ❌ **Opaque Systems**: Players should understand why their economy is succeeding or failing

### Military System  

**What It Is:**
EU4-style army recruitment, movement, and combat, but with political consequences for military actions.

**What It Should Feel Like:**
- **Strategic Weight**: Military decisions matter beyond just winning battles
- **Political Consequences**: "Victory in this war made my generals heroes, but now they expect more campaigns"
- **Resource Planning**: Building and maintaining armies requires careful economic management

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ **Pure Numbers Game**: Combat shouldn't just be about having more troops
- ❌ **Consequence-Free Warfare**: Wars should have lasting political and economic effects
- ❌ **Micromanagement Hell**: Army management should stay strategic, not tactical

### Diplomacy System

**What It Is:**
Basic but meaningful diplomatic options - alliances, wars, trade agreements, peace negotiations.

**What It Should Feel Like:**
- **Reputation Matters**: Other nations remember how you've acted
- **Interest Group Opinions**: Some groups prefer war, others prefer trade and peace
- **Long-term Relationships**: Diplomatic decisions create lasting consequences

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ **AI Exploitation**: Diplomatic systems shouldn't be easily gamed
- ❌ **Meaningless Treaties**: Agreements should have real effects and be worth maintaining
- ❌ **One-Dimensional Relations**: Countries should have complex, evolving relationships

## Emotional Journey & Player Psychology

### Early Game (Discovery)
**Target Feeling**: "I'm learning how to be a ruler"
- Players discover how their actions affect interest groups
- Mistakes have consequences but aren't game-ending
- Success feels earned through understanding, not exploitation

### Mid Game (Mastery)
**Target Feeling**: "I understand my people and how to lead them"
- Players can predict group reactions and plan accordingly
- Challenges become more complex as the empire grows
- Political management becomes as important as external expansion

### Late Game (Legacy)
**Target Feeling**: "I'm shaping the future of my civilization"  
- Major decisions have empire-spanning consequences
- Interest group dynamics become more sophisticated
- Players see long-term results of their political choices

## What Makes This Different

### Vs Europa Universalis IV
- **No Monarch Points**: No arbitrary "mana" limiting what you can do
- **Real Politics**: Interest groups react like actual political constituencies, not just flavor text
- **Meaningful Internal Challenges**: Domestic politics aren't just something to optimize away

### Vs Crusader Kings III
- **State-Level Focus**: You play as the nation, not individual characters
- **No Micromanagement Hell**: Character relationships are abstracted into interest groups
- **Clearer Strategic Focus**: Less soap opera, more statecraft

### Vs Total War Series
- **Politics First**: Military conquest is just one tool among many
- **Long-term Thinking**: Emphasis on decades/centuries rather than individual battles
- **Economic Integration**: Economy isn't just about funding armies

### Vs Victoria Series
- **Accessible Complexity**: Simpler economic systems but deeper political consequences
- **Ancient World Focus**: Different challenges than industrial-era games
- **Interest Group Clarity**: Fewer, more understandable political factions

## Critical Success Factors

### The Game Must Feel Like Ruling
- Players should think in terms of **political strategy**, not mathematical optimization
- Decisions should feel **weighty** - like they matter beyond immediate game mechanics
- Success should come from **understanding your society**, not exploiting game systems

### Interest Groups Must Feel Alive
- Groups should have **consistent personalities** and believable motivations
- Their reactions should be **predictable but not mechanical** - understandable but not exploitable
- They should create **emergent political situations** that feel like real governance challenges

### Progression Must Stay Engaging
- **Early expansion** shouldn't make the game trivial
- **Political complexity** should increase with empire size
- **New challenges** should emerge as old ones are mastered

---

## Major Pitfalls to Avoid

### The "Mana Problem"
- ❌ Don't gate interesting decisions behind arbitrary point accumulation
- ❌ Don't make the game about waiting for timers to run down
- ✅ Make limitations feel political and realistic, not mechanical

### The "Optimization Trap"
- ❌ Don't create systems where there's always an objectively correct choice
- ❌ Don't let players ignore politics by stacking modifiers
- ✅ Make trade-offs meaningful and context-dependent

### The "Complexity Creep"
- ❌ Don't add systems just because other games have them
- ❌ Don't make simple concepts needlessly complicated
- ✅ Every system should reinforce the core political gameplay

### The "Late Game Tedium"
- ❌ Don't let the game become unmanageable when you're successful
- ❌ Don't make expansion purely beneficial without political costs
- ✅ Make larger empires more politically complex, not just bigger

### The "AI Irrelevance"
- ❌ Don't let AI become passive or predictable
- ❌ Don't make other nations feel like static obstacles
- ✅ AI should create dynamic political situations and respond to player actions meaningfully

## Target Experience Summary

**The Perfect Session**:
A player sits down for an hour and faces a meaningful political dilemma - maybe their military wants to expand eastward, but their economy is strained and their population is war-weary. They decide to negotiate a trade agreement instead, which pleases merchants but makes generals restless. Twenty game-years later, they're dealing with the consequences of that choice - a stronger economy but rumors of military discontent. They understand exactly why they're in this situation and have clear, interesting options for how to handle it.

**The Perfect Campaign**:
Over several sessions, a player guides their nation from a small Mediterranean city-state to a regional power. They can point to specific political decisions that shaped their empire's character - maybe they consistently favored merchants, creating a trade-focused republic, or they kept military factions happy, becoming an expansionist warrior state. The end result feels like **their unique version** of that civilization, shaped by the political choices they made along the way.
