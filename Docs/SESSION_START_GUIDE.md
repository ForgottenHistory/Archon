# Session Start Guide - Quick Reference

**Purpose:** Quick checklist to start a productive AI coding session

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (2 minutes)

```
1. Copy Log/TEMPLATE.md ‚Üí Log/YYYY-MM-DD-name.md
2. Tell Claude: "Read CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md, and Log/[last-session].md"
3. Brief Claude on today's goal
4. Start coding!
```

---

## üìã Full Session Start Checklist

### Before You Start
- [ ] Know your goal for this session
- [ ] Have relevant architecture docs identified
- [ ] Check if any Planning/ docs need to be reviewed

### Claude's Reading Order
```
1. Assets/CLAUDE.md
   ‚Üí Core rules, constraints, must-follow patterns

2. Docs/Engine/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md
   ‚Üí Current system status, quick reference

3. Docs/Log/[most-recent-session].md
   ‚Üí What we tried last, decisions made, next steps

4. Docs/Engine/[specific-doc].md (as needed)
   ‚Üí System-specific details for today's work
```

### Your Session Prep
- [ ] Create new log file: `Log/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- [ ] Copy from TEMPLATE.md
- [ ] Fill in "Session Goal" section
- [ ] Note any context from previous sessions

---

## üéØ Effective Prompts

### Starting the Session

**‚úÖ Good:**
```
"Read CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md, and Log/2025-09-29-map-rendering.md.

Today we're implementing province selection (Phase 2.3 from map-system-architecture.md).
Read map-system-architecture.md for context.

Goal: Async GPU readback for mouse‚Üíprovince lookup.
Keep it under 1ms per selection."
```

**‚ùå Bad:**
```
"Help me with the map stuff"
```

### During the Session

**Ask for architecture compliance:**
```
"Before we implement this, check if it follows our dual-layer architecture.
Reference master-architecture-document.md."
```

**Cite documentation:**
```
"This approach - does it match the pattern in performance-architecture-guide.md?"
```

**Link previous work:**
```
"We tried something similar in Log/2025-09-28-x.md - what did we learn?"
```

**Your prep:**
- Document the symptom clearly
- Note what you've already tried
- Have reproduction steps ready

### 3. Architecture Review
**Goal:** Evaluate if code matches docs
**Claude reads:**
- ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md
- Specific architecture docs to verify
- Recent implementation logs

**Your prep:**
- Identify which system to audit
- Have specific concerns or questions

**Your prep:**
- Know why you're refactoring (performance? clarity?)
- Have metrics/goals
- Understand current approach (read old logs)

### 5. Planning Session
**Goal:** Design a new feature
**Claude reads:**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Starting Cold
**Mistake:** "Hey Claude, can you help with province loading?"
**Problem:** No context, will ask basic questions, waste time

**‚úÖ Fix:** "Read these docs [list], here's what we're doing today"

### ‚ùå Not Logging During Session
**Mistake:** "I'll write the log at the end"
**Problem:** You'll forget decisions, why things didn't work, context

**‚úÖ Fix:** Keep log file open, jot notes as you go

### ‚ùå Ignoring Previous Logs
**Mistake:** Not reading what you tried before
**Problem:** Repeat failed approaches

**‚úÖ Fix:** Claude reads last session, you review "What Didn't Work"

### ‚ùå Vague Goals
**Mistake:** "Make the map faster"
**Problem:** Unclear success, no direction

**‚úÖ Fix:** "Reduce province selection time from 5ms to <1ms"

### ‚ùå No Architecture Check
**Mistake:** Jump into implementation
**Problem:** Violate architectural constraints, have to redo

**‚úÖ Fix:** "Does this approach fit our dual-layer architecture?"

## üìä Session Quality Checklist

**Good session indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Clear goal stated upfront
- ‚úÖ Claude read relevant docs before starting
- ‚úÖ Decisions documented as made
- ‚úÖ Failed approaches noted (with why)
- ‚úÖ Next steps defined
- ‚úÖ Architecture compliance verified
- ‚úÖ Log updated before ending

**Warning signs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Claude asking basic architecture questions (didn't read docs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Trying approaches you already failed at (didn't read logs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear why you're making certain choices (document now!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Code doesn't match architecture (stop, review docs)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not sure what to do next (needs clearer goals)

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Read Selectively
You don't need to read entire docs. Tell Claude:
```
"Read the 'Performance Patterns' section of performance-architecture-guide.md"
"Skim map-system-architecture.md for compute shader patterns"
```

### Tip 2: Build on Logs
After 3-4 sessions on same system, logs contain rich context:
```
"Read all logs from 2025-09-27 to 2025-09-30 about map rendering.
What patterns emerged? What consistently didn't work?"
```

### Tip 3: Quick Context Refresh
If you haven't worked on the project in a while:
```
"Read ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md and the last 3 session logs.
Summarize: Where are we? What's the current focus?"
```

### Tip 4: Prevent Scope Creep
State your scope explicitly:
```
"Today's scope: ONLY implement async province selection.
Don't suggest improving other parts of the map system."
```

### Tip 5: Use Logs as Research
Before implementing new feature:
```
"Search all logs for 'compute shader' - what have we learned?"
```

## üéì Learning from Sessions

### After 5-10 Sessions
Review your logs and ask:
- What patterns keep appearing?
- What anti-patterns keep causing problems?
- Are there learnings to extract to `Log/learnings/`?
- Are there decisions to formalize in `Log/decisions/`?

### After 20-30 Sessions
Consider:
- Creating a "Common Pitfalls" document
- Adding proven patterns to architecture docs
- Archiving old logs (keep recent 2-3 months easily accessible)
- Reviewing if log template needs updating
